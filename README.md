Parental education had a bigger effect on male students.
Reading scores were the highest, Math scores were the lowest.

Modeling:
Tested several regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, CatBoost, XGBoost, SVM, Ridge, Lasso, KNN, and Decision Tree.
Linear Regression performed best with an 87% RÂ² score.
Outcome:
The analysis provides useful insights to help guide education policies and student support programs.
